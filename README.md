# Rate Deck Parsing
There are several strategies for how to approach this depending on the number of accounts and frequency you have to handle. 

WHAT: Automate parsing of supplier rate decks, i.e. find the data you need in the files and convert it to a format that your system accepts. The assumptions is that the cost lists from suppliers are sent as email attachements in either CSV or any kind of spreadsheet format like xlsx. 

WHY: This process is highly manual today, taking a lot of work labor efforts with high risk of mistakes that can lead to margin loss because of error in cost or price list management. Changes the needs attention can also happen outside of office hours or other times when staff is not available for manual handling.
